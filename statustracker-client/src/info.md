StatusTracker 2 by \_\_7d

### History

StatusTracker was originally built for the Minecart Rapid Transit server to protest the lack of staff members. I first mentioned it on their Discord server on the 11th of November 2020, one month after a major controversial event that resulted in a signifiant loss in number of staff members:

> "my main reason to build my statustracker is because of complaining about lack of staff"

At first the data was hosted on JSON files in Replit; however due to how Replit works the data is always purged every few hours. I never thought about it again until 7 months later in June 2021... and then I somehow forgot about it (I think?) until September 2021 when the server's forum was discussing about the lack of staff in (a) certain timezone(s). People suggested improving the UI and updating the code to save the data so that it would be useful for the discussion, so I changed the database to MongoDB and StatusTracker 1 had been running since 14 September 2021, and was then completely forgotten again until the 24th of October 2022. I decided to rewrite the tracker to track individual people too, and make the UI and code better. StatusTracker 2 was released on insert date around its 2nd anniversary.
